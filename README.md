# Metro-Route-Planar

This Metro Route Planner uses Dijkstra’s Algorithm to find the shortest travel path between metro stations. It models the metro system as a weighted graph, where stations are nodes and routes are edges with travel times as weights. The program efficiently computes the shortest path, providing an optimized route and estimated travel time for better navigation.

Key Features
Graph-Based Representation: The metro system is modeled as a weighted graph where stations are nodes, and routes (edges) have travel time as weights.
Dijkstra’s Algorithm Implementation: Ensures efficient shortest path computation for metro navigation.
User-Friendly Input System: Users can dynamically add stations, define routes, and specify travel times.
Priority Queue Optimization: Uses a min-heap to enhance performance when selecting the next shortest path.
Clear Route Output: Displays the optimal path with an estimated travel time for better user experience.

Technologies Used
Programming Language: Java/Python (as per implementation)
Data Structures: Graphs, Priority Queue (Min-Heap)
Algorithm: Dijkstra’s Shortest Path Algorithm
