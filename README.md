# Metro-Route-Planar
This Metro Route Planner uses Dijkstra’s Algorithm to find the shortest path between metro stations. It represents the metro system as a graph with stations as nodes and routes as weighted edges. The program efficiently calculates the optimal route and estimated travel time for easy navigation.

Key Features
Graph-Based Representation: The metro system is modeled as a weighted graph where stations are nodes, and routes (edges) have travel time as weights.Dijkstra’s Algorithm Implementation: Ensures efficient shortest path computation for metro navigation.
User-Friendly Input System: Users can dynamically add stations, define routes, and specify travel times.
Priority Queue Optimization: Uses a min-heap to enhance performance when selecting the next shortest path.
Clear Route Output: Displays the optimal path with an estimated travel time for better user experience.

Technologies Used
Programming Language: Java/Python (as per implementation)
Data Structures: Graphs, Priority Queue (Min-Heap)
Algorithm: Dijkstra’s Shortest Path Algorithm
