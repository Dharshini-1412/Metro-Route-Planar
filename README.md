# Metro-Route-Planar
This Metro Route Planner uses Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm to find the shortest path between metro stations. It represents the metro system as a graph with stations as nodes and routes as weighted edges. The program efficiently calculates the optimal route and estimated travel time for easy navigation.
